# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
In this assignment, I was challenged to create four different types of CSS files for the same portfolio HTML. I found out that each method had distinct advantages. For example, hand-written CSS offered the most control but it was kind of hard to find out where to start. AI-generated CSS provided creative ideas that I wouldn't have thought of. The hybrid approach combined the best of both handwritten and ai css.

The hand-written CSS took up alot of time and it was really time-consuming but resulted in cleaner and neater code. The AI approaches generated comprehensive styling quickly but often needed refinement for accessibility and performance optimization. The hybrid solution allowed me to leverage AI's creativity while applying my design sensibilities and optimization knowledge.

Each css approach produced noticeably different visual results despite styling the same type of content. This assignment demonstrated how powerful CSS can be in transforming a website's look and feel without changing the HTML structure.

## Lessons Learned
I have learned alot of about how to style both your html and css. I learned more about css can transform your website into something magical. With the css approaches I was able to see changes that would go well with my website and how I can improve on my website. 

## Preferred Version
I prefer the handwritten solution because once you know how your want your create your website then your would be able to figour out how to do it. My handwritten maintains a clean, efficient structure that shows both your creative and imagination.
